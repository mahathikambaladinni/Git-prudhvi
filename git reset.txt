GIT RESET



Git add .----moves to staging area
Commit---commits the changes

Soft----commit id is deleted and changes remains same moves from comes back from commit area
Mixed---commit id is deleted and chenges done remains same comes back from staging area
Hard--changes are deleted and comes three stages back 


In git reset we have three types

Git reset --soft commitid

Git reset--mixed commitid
Git reset--hard commitid

Soft
Comes back from staging area-----------one step back

Take below example



Now edited the file as below





Now creating first commit







Do some changes in file again and go for 2nd commit







Now if we want to revert changes done in 2nd commit then we have to reset 1st commit
As shown below
Note down the first 7 digits in 1st commit


Now you can 2nd commit eliminated from git log and file comes back from staging area



But file will be same as chanages done before doing  second commit



Only commit id is deleted from log and file come backs from commit area
Changes in file remain the same

Now lets take example of mixed reset---2 stages back

take new file


Edits done in file1

Do git add . and commit 





Now go forsecond commit



Now if we want the 2nd commit to be reverted and unstage
Changes in file remain the same




If we want the changes also to be deleted then we use hard 3 stages back


Take new file


Now do git add and commit







Now do second commit mean while after commit check log and status





You can see second commit is deleted and changes done in second commit are also deleted
